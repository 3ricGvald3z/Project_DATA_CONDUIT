### **OPERATIONAL GUIDE**

The `data_processor.sh` binary is executed from your terminal.

```
# Display the full mission parameters (help menu)
./data_processor.sh -h

# Process a file, automatically detecting the delimiter
./data_processor.sh your_data_file.txt

# Process a comma-separated file, skipping the first 3 lines (header/comments)
./data_processor.sh -d ',' -s 3 your_data_file.txt

# Reformat data to a JSON output, skipping the header
./data_processor.sh -s 1 -f json your_data_file.txt

# Reformat data to Markdown for documentation
./data_processor.sh -f md your_data_file.txt
